Weblo is built for people who want more control: block what you don’t need, automate with userscripts, keep pages offline, organize with profiles and categories, and inspect what’s really happening behind the scenes. Simple for everyday browsing, powerful when you want to dig deeper.

### Translation

Weblo currently supports 23 languages, most of which are implemented using generative AI. Thus, the quality of translations is not guaranteed.  
If you are a native speaker or have skills in one of the supported languages, feel free to contribute to the translations.

* Translations don't need to be exact — you can express things in your own words.
* It doesn't matter whether you have used AI, as long as you validate the quality.
* If you want to add a new language, please contact the developer beforehand.
